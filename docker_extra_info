## You can execute other commands in the daemonized -d container with exec, such as:

docker exec -ti CONTAINER_ID bash

The above will start a bash session in the same container, 
which is great for taking a look around if you need to and perform one-off maintenance tasks.

docker volume prune

docker run -t -i -v '/on/my/host:/on/the/container'-v /on/my/host/2:/on/the/container/2 \ ubuntu /bin/bash

Stop and remove all containers
You can review the containers on your system with docker ps. Adding the -a flag will show all containers. When youâ€™re sure you want to delete them, you can add the -q flag to supply the IDs to the docker stop and docker rm commands:

List:

docker ps -a
Remove:

docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker volume prune
