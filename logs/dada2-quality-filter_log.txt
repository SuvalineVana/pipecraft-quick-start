Description:

Package:                dada2
Type:                   Package
Title:                  Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                        amplicon sequencing data
Description:            The dada2 package infers exact amplicon
                        sequence variants (ASVs) from high-throughput
                        amplicon sequencing data, replacing the coarser
                        and less accurate OTU clustering approach. The
                        dada2 pipeline takes as input demultiplexed
                        fastq files, and outputs the sequence variants
                        and their sample-wise abundances after removing
                        substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                        classification is available via a native
                        implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                        classifier, and species-level assignment to 16S
                        rRNA gene fragments by exact matching.
