      7303  Pairs
      3843  Merged (52.6%)
      3460  Not merged (47.4%)

Pairs that failed merging due to various reasons:
        21  multiple potential alignments
      2888  too many differences
       539  alignment score too low, or score drop too high
        12  staggered read pairs

Statistics of all reads:
